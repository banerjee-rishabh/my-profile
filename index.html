						<h1>Hello, I'm Rishabh</h1>

						<h2>Music</h2>
						<p>
						One of my biggest hobbies is actively listening to music, and going to see my favourite artists live in concert wherever possible. My hobby for music goes deeper than just listening to it - I dive into different genres of music, while making different playlists for different moods and vibes. I also love to take the time to analyse the lyrics and compositions of many different songs to understand the craftsmanship involved in making different songs and albums.

						<h2>Cooking</h2>
						<p>
						When I am not busy with work or school, I always find myself in the kitchen using different ingredients to make food from around the world. I have been cooking ever since I child, making meals from around the world for my family and friends. I love to get in the kitchen and see what I have in the pantry and then develop recipes and experiment with what I have. I think itâ€™s a great way to learn about other cultures and making food for my friends is always a nice way to spend time with them!

						<h2>Travelling</h2>
						<p>
							Another one of my hobbies is travelling the world to experience different countries and cultures. While I am only 18 years old, I have visited nearly 50 countries in my life from Martinique to Japan, exploring the different cultures and comparing them to my own environment. I love to travel since I believe it makes me more aware of the world around us and gives me a better perspective on the way other people live. I am always excited to travel and see new places!
